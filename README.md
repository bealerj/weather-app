# Weather App

## Local Dev
This app has an .nvmrc file so be sure to either run `nvm use` before running `npm i` for the first time.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

This renders a simple weather app that has a search bar that takes a city name as input and displays the current weather.
If there is a problem retrieving the data (ex. a mis-spelled city name), an alert will notify the user that the app was unable to retrieve the data.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests.
